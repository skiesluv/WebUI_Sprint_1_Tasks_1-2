    <h1 class="fh1">France national football team</h1>

    <p class="fparagraph1">
      The France national football team (French: Équipe de France de football),
      also colloquially known in the country as Les Bleus (The Blues),
      represents France in men's international football and is controlled by the
      French Football Federation (Fédération française de football). The team's
      colours are blue, white, and red, and the coq gaulois its symbol. They are
      the reigning world champions, having won the most recent World Cup final
      in 2018. France plays their home matches at the Stade de France in
      Saint-Denis, Île-de-France, and their manager is Didier Deschamps. They
      have won two FIFA World Cups, two UEFA European Championships, two FIFA
      Confederations Cups, one Artemio Franchi Trophy and one UEFA Nations
      League. France experienced much of its success in three different eras: in
      the 1980s, late 1990s/early 2000s and late 2010s, respectively, which
      resulted in numerous major honours. France was one of the four European
      teams that participated in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. Twenty-eight
      years later, the team, led by Raymond Kopa and Just Fontaine, finished in
      third place at the FIFA World Cup. In 1984, under the leadership of the
      three-time Ballon d'Or winner Michel Platini, it won UEFA Euro 1984 (its
      first official title), an Artemio Franchi Trophy (1985) and reach another
      two World Cup semi-finals (1982 and 1986). However, France only began to
      reach its prime from the 1990s onward, with the establishment of INF
      Clairefontaine. During the captaincy of Didier Deschamps and with Zinedine
      Zidane on the pitch, Les Bleus won the FIFA World Cup in 1998 and
      triumphed at UEFA Euro 2000, winning also the FIFA Confederations Cup in
      2001, retaining that title two years later the Deschamps' retirement, and
      reached the 2006 FIFA World Cup final, which it lost 5–3 on penalties to
      Italy. A decade later, the team reached the final of the UEFA European
      Championship, where they lost 1–0 to Portugal in extra time. It won the
      2018 FIFA World Cup, its second title in that competition, defeating
      Croatia 4–2 in the final match on 15 July 2018. Finally, the French team
      became the first European national team to have won all possible senior
      FIFA and confederation competitions after winning the UEFA Nations League
      on October 2021.

    <h2 class="fh2">History</h2>
    <p class="fparagraph2">
      The France national football team was created in 1904 around the time of
      FIFA's foundation on 21 May 1904 and contested its first official
      international match on 1 May 1904 against Belgium in Brussels, which ended
      in a 3–3 draw. The following year, on 12 February 1905, France contested
      their first-ever home match against Switzerland. The match was played at
      the Parc des Princes in front of 500 supporters. France won the match 1–0
      with the only goal coming from Gaston Cyprès. Due to disagreements between
      FIFA and the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques (USFSA),
      the country's sports union, France struggled to establish an identity. On
      9 May 1908, the French Interfederal Committee (CFI), a rival organization
      to the USFSA, ruled that FIFA would now be responsible for the club's
      appearances in forthcoming Olympic Games and not the USFSA. In 1919, the
      CFI transformed themselves into the French Football Federation (FFF). In
      1921, the USFSA finally merged with the FFF. In July 1930, France appeared
      in the inaugural FIFA World Cup, held in Uruguay. In their first-ever
      World Cup match, France defeated Mexico 4–1 at the Estadio Pocitos in
      Montevideo. Lucien Laurent became notable in the match as he scored not
      only France's first World Cup goal, but the first goal in World Cup
      history. Conversely, France also became the first team to not score in a
      match after losing 1–0 to fellow group stage opponents Argentina. Another
      loss to Chile resulted in the team bowing out in the group stage. The
      following year saw the first selection of a black player to the national
      team. Raoul Diagne, who was of Senegalese descent, earned his first cap on
      15 February in a 2–1 defeat to Czechoslovakia. Diagne later played with
      the team at the 1938 World Cup, alongside Larbi Benbarek, who was one of
      the first players of North African origin to play for the national team.
      At the 1934 World Cup, France suffered elimination in the opening round,
      losing 3–2 to Austria. On the team's return to Paris, they were greeted as
      heroes by a crowd of over 4,000 supporters. France hosted the 1938 World
      Cup and reached the quarterfinals, losing 3–1 to defending champions
      Italy. The 1950s saw France handed its first Golden Generation composed of
      players such as Just Fontaine, Raymond Kopa, Jean Vincent, Robert Jonquet,
      Maryan Wisnieski, Thadée Cisowski, and Armand Penverne. At the 1958 World
      Cup, France reached the semi-finals losing to Brazil. In the third-place
      match, France defeated West Germany 6–3 with Fontaine recording four
      goals, which brought his goal tally in the competition to 13, a World Cup
      record. The record still stands today. France hosted the inaugural UEFA
      European Football Championship in 1960 and, for the second straight
      international tournament, reached the semi-finals. In the round, France
      faced Yugoslavia and were shocked 5–4 despite being up 4–2 heading into
      the 75th minute. In the third-place match, France was defeated 2–0 by the
      Czechoslovakians. The 1960s and 70s saw France decline significantly
      playing under several managers and failing to qualify for numerous
      international tournaments. On 25 April 1964, Henri Guérin was officially
      installed as the team's first manager. Under Guérin, France failed to
      qualify for the 1962 World Cup and the 1964 European Nations' Cup. The
      team did return to major international play following qualification for
      the 1966 World Cup. The team lost in the group stage portion of the
      tournament. Guérin was fired following the World Cup. He was replaced by
      José Arribas and Jean Snella, who worked as caretaker managers in dual
      roles. The two only lasted four matches and were replaced by former
      international Just Fontaine, who only lasted two. Louis Dugauguez
      succeeded Fontaine and following his early struggles in qualification for
      the 1970 World Cup, was fired and replaced by Georges Boulogne, who could
      not get the team to the competition. Boulogne was later fired following
      his failure to qualify for the 1974 World Cup and was replaced by the
      Romanian Ștefan Kovács, who became the only international manager to ever
      manage the national team. Kovács also turned out to be a disappointment
      failing to qualify for the 1974 World Cup and UEFA Euro 1976. After two
      years in charge, he was sacked and replaced with Michel Hidalgo. Under
      Hidalgo, France flourished, mainly due to the accolades of great players
      like defenders Marius Trésor and Maxime Bossis, striker Dominique
      Rocheteau and midfielder Michel Platini, who, alongside Jean Tigana, Alain
      Giresse and Luis Fernández formed the "carré magique" ("Magic Square"),
      which would haunt opposing defenses beginning at the 1982 World Cup, where
      France reached the semi-finals losing on penalties to rivals West Germany.
      The semi-final match-up is considered one of the greatest matches in World
      Cup history and was marred with controversy. France earned their first
      major international honor two years later, winning Euro 1984, which they
      hosted. Under the leadership of Platini, who scored a tournament-high nine
      goals, France defeated Spain 2–0 in the final. Platini and Bruno Bellone
      scored the goals. Following the Euro triumph, Hidalgo departed the team
      and was replaced by former international Henri Michel. France later
      completed the hat-trick when they won gold at the 1984 Summer Olympics
      football tournament and, a year later, defeated Uruguay 2–0 to win the
      Artemio Franchi Trophy, an early precursor to the FIFA Confederations Cup.
      Dominique Rocheteau and José Touré scored the goals. In a span of a year,
      France were holders of three of the four major international trophies. At
      the 1986 World Cup, France were favorites to win the competition, and, for
      the second consecutive World Cup, reached the semi-finals where they faced
      West Germany. Again, however, they lost. A 4–2 victory over Belgium gave
      France third place. In 1988, the FFF opened the Clairefontaine National
      Football Institute. Its opening ceremony was attended by then-President of
      France, François Mitterrand. Five months after Clairefontaine's opening,
      manager Henri Michel was fired and was replaced by Michel Platini, who
      failed to get the team to the 1990 World Cup. Platini did lead the team to
      Euro 1992 and, despite going on a 19-match unbeaten streak prior to the
      competition, suffered elimination in the group stage. A week after the
      completion of the tournament, Platini stepped down as manager and was
      replaced by his assistant Gérard Houllier. Under Houllier, France and its
      supporters experienced a heartbreaking meltdown after having qualification
      to the 1994 World Cup all but secured with two matches to go, which were
      against last place Israel and Bulgaria. In the match against Israel,
      France was upset 3–2 and, in the Bulgaria match, suffered an astronomical
      2–1 defeat. The subsequent blame and public outcry to the firing of
      Houllier and departure of several players from the national team fold. His
      assistant Aimé Jacquet was given his post. Under Jacquet, the national
      team experienced its triumphant years. The squad composed of veterans that
      failed to reach the 1994 FIFA World Cup were joined by influential
      youngsters, such as Zinedine Zidane. The team started off well reaching
      the semi-finals of Euro 1996, where they lost 6–5 on penalties to the
      Czech Republic. In the team's next major tournament at the 1998 World Cup
      at home, Jacquet led France to glory defeating Brazil 3–0 in the final at
      the Stade de France in Paris. Jacquet stepped down after the country's
      World Cup triumph and was succeeded by assistant Roger Lemerre who guided
      them through Euro 2000. Led by FIFA World Player of the Year Zidane,
      France defeated Italy 2–1 in the final. David Trezeguet scored the golden
      goal in extra time. The victory gave the team the distinction of being the
      first national team to hold both the World Cup and Euro titles since West
      Germany did so in 1974, and it was also the first time that a reigning
      World Cup winner went on to capture the Euro. Following the result, the
      France national team was inserted to the number one spot in the FIFA World
      Rankings. France failed to maintain that pace in subsequent tournaments.
      Although, the team won the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, France suffered a
      first-round elimination at the 2002 World Cup. One of the greatest shocks
      in World Cup history saw France condemned to a 1–0 defeat to debutantes
      Senegal in the opening game of the tournament. France became the second
      nation to be eliminated in the first-round while holding the World Cup
      crown, the first one being Brazil in 1966. After the 2010, 2014, and 2018
      World Cups, Italy, Spain, and Germany were also added to this list. After
      France finished bottom of the group, Lemerre was dismissed and was
      replaced by Jacques Santini. A full-strength team started out strongly at
      Euro 2004, but they were upset in the quarter-finals by the eventual
      winners Greece. Santini resigned as coach and Raymond Domenech was picked
      as his replacement. France struggled in the early qualifiers for the 2006
      World Cup. This prompted Domenech to persuade several past members out of
      international retirement to help the national team qualify, which they
      accomplished following a convincing 4–0 win over Cyprus on the final day
      of qualifying. In the 2006 World Cup final stages, France finished
      undefeated in the group stage portion and advanced all the way to the
      final defeating the likes of Spain, Brazil, and Portugal en route. France
      played Italy in the final and, in part down to controversial disruptions
      in extra time that lead to captain Zinedine Zidane being sent off, failed
      to find a winning goal, Italy winning 5–3 on penalties to be crowned World
      Cup champions. France started its qualifying round for Euro 2008 strong
      and qualified for the tournament, despite two defeats to Scotland. France
      bowed out during the group stage portion of the tournament after having
      been placed in the group of death (which included Netherlands and Italy).
      Just like the team's previous World Cup qualifying campaign, the 2010
      campaign got off to a disappointing start with France suffering disastrous
      losses and earning uninspired victories. France eventually finished second
      in the group and earned a spot in the UEFA play-offs against the Republic
      of Ireland for a place in South Africa. In the first leg, France defeated
      the Irish 1–0 and in the second leg procured a 1–1 draw, via controversial
      circumstances, to qualify for the World Cup. In the 2010 World Cup final
      stages, the team continued to perform under expectations and were
      eliminated in the group stage, while the negative publicity the national
      team received during the competition led to further repercussions back in
      France. Midway through the competition, striker Nicolas Anelka was
      dismissed from the national team after reportedly having a dispute, in
      which obscenities were passed, with team manager Raymond Domenech during
      half-time of the team's loss to Mexico. The resulting disagreement over
      Anelka's expulsion between the players, the coaching staff and FFF
      officials resulted in the players boycotting training before their third
      game. In response to the training boycott, Sports Minister Roselyne
      Bachelot lectured the players and "reduced France's disgraced World Cup
      stars to tears with an emotional speech on the eve of their final group A
      match". France then lost their final game 2–1 to the hosts South Africa
      and failed to advance to the knockout stage. The day after the team's
      elimination, it was reported by numerous media outlets that then President
      of France Nicolas Sarkozy would meet with team captain Thierry Henry to
      discuss the issues associated with the team's meltdown at the World Cup,
      at Henry's request. Following the completion of the World Cup tournament,
      Federation President Jean-Pierre Escalettes resigned from his position.
      Domenech, whose contract already expired, was succeeded as head coach by
      former international Laurent Blanc. On 23 July 2010, at the request of
      Blanc, the FFF suspended all 23 players in the World Cup squad for the
      team's friendly match against Norway after the World Cup. On 6 August,
      five players who were deemed to have played a major role in the training
      boycott were disciplined for their roles. At Euro 2012 in Poland and
      Ukraine, France reached the quarter-finals, where they were beaten by
      eventual champions Spain. Following the tournament, coach Laurent Blanc
      resigned and was succeeded by Didier Deschamps, who captained France to
      glory in the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000. His team qualified for the 2014
      World Cup by beating Ukraine in the playoffs, and Deschamps then extended
      his contract until Euro 2016. Missing star midfielder Franck Ribéry
      through injury, France lost to eventual champions Germany in the
      quarter-finals courtesy of an early goal by Mats Hummels. Paul Pogba was
      awarded the Best Young Player award during the tournament. France
      automatically qualified as hosts for Euro 2016. Karim Benzema and Hatem
      Ben Arfa were not in the squad. France were drawn in Group A of the
      tournament alongside Romania, Switzerland and Albania. France won their
      group with wins over Romania and Albania and a goalless draw against
      Switzerland and were poised to play the Republic of Ireland in the round
      of sixteen. Ireland took the lead after just two minutes through a
      controversially awarded penalty, which was converted by Robbie Brady. A
      brace from Antoine Griezmann, however, helped France to win the match 2–1
      and qualify for the quarter-finals, where they beat a resilient Iceland
      5–2 to set up a semi-final clash against world champions and tournament
      co-favourites Germany. France won the match 2–0, marking their first win
      over Germany at a major tournament since 1958. France, however, were
      beaten by Portugal 1–0 in the final courtesy of an extra-time goal by
      Eder. Griezmann was named the Player of the Tournament and was also
      awarded the Golden Boot in addition to being named in the Team of the
      Tournament, alongside Dimitri Payet. The defeat meant that France became
      the second nation to have lost the final on home soil, after Portugal lost
      the final to Greece in 2004. In 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying, France
      topped their group with 23 points; winning 7 wins, drawing 2 and losing
      once, although their two draws were against considerably weaker nations,
      drawing 0–0 with Belarus in their opening match and against Luxembourg,
      failing to secure a win against the latter since 1914, nearly 103 years.
      Their only defeat of the qualifying phase was against Sweden; losing 2–1
      in the last few minutes following an error from goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.
      France secured qualification to the World Cup finals with a 2–1 win over
      Belarus after atomizing the Netherlands 4 to 0 at home a few weeks
      earlier. They were drawn to play Australia, Peru and Denmark in a group in
      which they were considered heavy favourites. Overall, due to the strength
      and value of their squad, France were tipped by many as one of the
      favourites for the title. France, however, had a somewhat disappointing
      performance in the group stage, only managing a 2–1 win over Australia and
      a 1–0 win over Peru, followed by a match against Denmark which finished in
      a 0–0 draw. France beat Argentina 4–3 in the round of sixteen and then
      Uruguay 2–0 to qualify for the semi-final stage, where they beat Belgium
      1–0 courtesy of a goal from defender Samuel Umtiti. On 15 July, France
      beat Croatia in the final with result 4–2 to win the World Cup for the
      second time. Didier Deschamps became the third man to win the World Cup as
      a player and a coach and also became the second man to win the title as a
      captain and a coach. Kylian Mbappé was awarded the Best Young Player award
      and Antoine Griezmann was awarded the Bronze Ball and the Silver Boot for
      their performance during the tournament. Upon scoring in the final, Mbappé
      became only the second teenager to score in a World Cup Final, the last
      being Pelé in 1958.
